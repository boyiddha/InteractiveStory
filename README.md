     <ul style="list-style-typeðŸ”´">
        <li> Users can read already-written stories. </li>
       <li>When a user opens a story to read it, readers are allowed to interact with the story and shape its outcome.</li>
       <li>>Rather than being limited to a linear narrative, readers can choose from a variety of options to determine where the story will go. This means that every reader can have a unique experience and create their own story. It also means that readers can go back and explore different paths and endings.</li>
     </ul>

  <li> Popularity Tracking Section 
      <ul style="list-style-typeðŸ”´">
