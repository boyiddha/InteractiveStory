		<h1>Interactive Story?</h1><br>
		
        <p>Interactive storytelling, also known as interactive storytelling, is a form of storytelling where readers 
		are given the opportunity to interact with the story and shape its outcome. It is often done through a combination 
		of text and images, and sometimes audio and video, to create a gripping and engaging narrative.
		<br><br>

		Rather than being limited to a linear narrative, readers can choose from a variety of options to determine 
		where the story will go. This means that every reader can have a unique experience and create their own story. 
		It also means that readers can go back and explore different paths and endings.
		<br><br>

		An interactive story can be used to create stories with multiple endings or stories that evolve over time 
		and change based on the reader's preferences. It's a great way to engage readers and get them invested in the story.
